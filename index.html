    <h1 class="title">The Connections</h1>
    <div class="paragraph">
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a span of approximately 1,500 years, Bible, a compilation of 66 books became the most known book in the world. Even so, how can a different books written in a large interval of time connected to each other? How is the connection of the Bible proved that it is directly inspired by one source?</p>

      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The book centralized about God fulfilling his promise of redemption after the Human fall in sin at the start of the Bible(Genesis 3). The Bible’s storyline talks about the process of God fulfilling his promise and restoring his promise by sending his son Jesus to die for our sins (John 3:16). The Bible is divided into two parts, the Old and the New Testament. The Old Testament prophesies the coming of the Messiah that will happen in the New testament emphasizing the importance of the fulfillment of the process. This approach teaches us to view the Old Testament not merely as a collection of historical accounts and laws but as a foreshadowing of Christ's coming and the establishment of God's kingdom on earth.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Old and the New Testament are connected as the Old testament serves as an introduction and foundation for the events in the New testament. Both testaments reveal God's character, His plan for salvation, and His desire for relationship with humanity. The Old Testament primarily focuses on the covenant relationship between God and Israel, while the New Testament expands this covenant to include all humanity through Jesus Christ. The Old Testament anticipates the coming Messiah, while the New Testament declares His arrival and establishes the new covenant in His blood.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Bible consists of 5 covenants, each showing God’s character and commitment to his plans leading to fulfilling of his promises. Making a covenant with Moses, Abraham, Adam, Noah, and David, God chose these faithful individuals to reach a common goal. These covenants provide the framework for understanding the Bible's central theme of redemption and highlight the progression of God's plan throughout history.</p>

       <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The various sections of the Bible, such as the Pentateuch, Historical Books, Wisdom, Prophets, Gospels, Epistles, and Revelation, work together to advance the Bible's storyline and emphasize its central theme. Each section contributes unique perspectives, teachings, and insights that collectively reveal God's redemptive work. The Old Testament sets the stage by highlighting humanity's need for a savior and God's faithfulness to His promises, while the New Testament reveals the fulfillment of those promises in Jesus Christ. Together, these sections  points to God's ultimate plan of redemption for all humanity.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Biblical Worldview</h1>
      <div class="paragraph">
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The whole Bible follows a linear progress; Creation, Fall, and Redemption also known as CFR. The beginning of the Bible talks about God creating everything including humans that he created according to his own image. Creations had a peaceful and pure life with God in the garden of Eden. However, it turned upside down  when Adam and Eve disobeyed God’s command. </p>
  
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This act of disobedience, commonly referred to as the Fall, introduced sin and brokenness into the world, disrupting the harmonious relationship between humanity and God. As a result of their disobedience, Adam and Eve experienced shame, guilt, and the consequences of their actions, including expulsion from the garden of Eden. This pivotal moment in the biblical narrative marks the beginning of humanity's struggle with sin and its devastating effects on the world.</p>
  
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the bleakness of the Fall, the Bible offers a message of hope through the theme of Redemption. Throughout the Old Testament, God demonstrates His faithfulness and mercy as He works through individuals and nations to fulfill His redemptive plan. The prophets foretell the coming of a Messiah who will ultimately bring salvation and restore the broken relationship between God and humanity.</p>
  
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This theme of Redemption finds its fulfillment in the person of Jesus Christ, whose life, death, and resurrection provide the ultimate solution to the problem of sin. Through His sacrificial death on the cross, Jesus offers forgiveness and reconciliation to all who believe in Him, restoring what was lost in the Fall. This act of redemption not only offers salvation to individuals but also extends to the entire creation, ushering in a new era of hope and restoration.</p>
  
         <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thus, the linear progression of Creation, Fall, and Redemption woven throughout the Bible serves as a foundational framework for understanding the human condition and God's plan of salvation. It reminds us of the inherent goodness of creation, the reality of sin and its consequences, and the unfathomable love and grace of God manifested in His redemptive work through Jesus Christ.</p>

        <h1 class="title">How Will AI Change The World</h1>
        <div class="paragraph">
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The video selected for this analysis explores the implications of artificial intelligence (AI) on society, particularly focusing on its transformative impact and the evolving relationship between humanity and technology. It delves into the advancements made in AI, highlighting the vast disparity between human ingenuity and the infinite creativity of God, as expressed in Isaiah 55:8-9. Additionally, the video underscores humanity's role as stewards over creation, as outlined in Genesis 1:26-28, emphasizing our responsibility and intellect above all other creatures. Despite acknowledging the benefits of technological progress, the video also raises concerns about society's increasing reliance on technology, warning against a potential drift away from dependence on God towards dependence on human achievement, as cautioned in Jeremiah 17:5 and 1 John 2:15-17.</p>
    
          <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In response to these challenges, the biblical worldview offers guidance for navigating the intersection of technology and faith. Christians are reminded by 1 Corinthians 10:31 to use all tools, including technology, for the glory of God. Rather than viewing technology as a threat to spiritual well-being, believers are called to approach it with discernment, recognizing its potential to advance God's kingdom and share the gospel message. This perspective encourages Christians to engage with technological innovation thoughtfully and intentionally, guided by the overarching narrative of Creation, Fall, and Redemption. By anchoring their perspective in biblical truth, believers can utilize technology as faithful stewards, leveraging its potential to glorify God and serve the common good in an ever-changing world.</p>
    
           <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This analysis emphasizes the importance of critically engaging with technological advancements from a biblical perspective, recognizing both the opportunities and challenges they present to faith and stewardship. It highlights the need for Christians to approach technology with discernment, guided by biblical principles, and to use it as a tool for advancing God's purposes in the world. While technology may present challenges to faith, it also offers unique opportunities for believers to fulfill their calling as ambassadors of Christ in the digital age.</p>
